                    <b>React 17 enables gradual React upgrades.</b> When you upgrade from React 15 to 16 (or, this time,
                    from
                    React 16 to 17), you would usually upgrade your whole app at once. This works well for many apps.
                    But it can get increasingly challenging if the codebase was written more than a few years ago and
                    isn’t actively maintained. And while it’s possible to use two versions of React on the page, until
                    React 17 this has been fragile and caused problems with events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We’re fixing many of those problems with React 17. This means that <b><em>when React 18 and the next
                            future
                            versions come out, you will now have more options.</em></b> The first option will be to
                    upgrade your whole
                    app at once, like you might have done before. But you will also have an option to upgrade your app
                    piece by piece. For example, you might decide to migrate most of your app to React 18, but keep some
                    lazy-loaded dialog or a subroute on React 17.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This doesn’t mean you have to do gradual upgrades. <u><b>For most apps, upgrading all at once is
                            still the
                            best solution.</b></u> Loading two versions of React — even if one of them is loaded lazily
                    on demand — is
                    still not ideal. However, for larger apps that aren’t actively maintained, this option makes sense
                    to consider, and React 17 lets those apps not get left behind.
                </p>

                        We’ve prepared an example repository demonstrating how to lazy-load an older version of React if
                        necessary. This demo uses Create React App, but it should be possible to follow a similar
                        approach
                        with any other tool. We welcome demos using other tooling as pull requests.
